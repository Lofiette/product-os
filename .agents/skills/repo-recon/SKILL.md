# repo-recon

## Purpose

Inspect an existing repository shallowly: stack, package manager, scripts, instructions, generated zones, patterns, tests.

## When to use

2. Load only relevant files/docs.
3. Separate evidence, assumptions, and hypotheses.
4. Produce the required compact artifact.
5. Report blockers and handoffs.
