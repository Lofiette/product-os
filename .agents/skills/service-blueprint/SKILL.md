# service-blueprint

## Purpose

Design service blueprint across frontstage/backstage actions, systems, policies, handoffs, and failure points.

## When to use

Use only when this workflow can improve decision quality, risk detection, implementation, verification, or handoff.

## Inputs

- TASK.md current scope.
- Relevant role playbook or role card.
- Relevant repo/design/research evidence.
- Approved orchestration mode.

## Process

1. Confirm this skill is needed for the current operation.
2. Load only relevant files/docs.
3. Separate evidence, assumptions, and hypotheses.
4. Produce the required compact artifact.
5. Report blockers and handoffs.

## Output schema
